//% Refunds are associated with  a Stripe Session (Cart). While we don't manage the context of a cart, we need only one refund per session, because that is WHAT STRIPE ALLOWS. We might also need partial refunds for a single charge (like x% of it)
//% When updating or solving the refund we will modify all purchases. This is the best for our current model.
